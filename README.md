Summary of Home Sales Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about home sales, specifically focusing on key metrics such as average home prices based on various criteria like the number of bedrooms, the year homes were built, and more. I used Apache Spark, a powerful tool for big data processing, to explore the dataset, perform calculations, and optimize the analysis.

Key Steps Taken:
Data Preparation and Exploration:
I began by loading the provided home sales data into Apache Spark. I then created a temporary table in Spark to work with the data using SQL queries.

Average Home Prices:
I answered several important questions about the dataset using SparkSQL:

What is the average price for a four-bedroom home sold each year?
What is the average price for homes built each year that have three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
I also looked at more specific subsets of the data, such as homes with at least 2,000 square feet and two floors, to analyze price trends.
Performance Optimization:

I used caching to speed up my queries. By caching the data in memory, I was able to run the same queries faster when needed again.
I then compared the performance of cached and uncached queries to see the improvement in speed.
Partitioning Data:

To further optimize query performance, I partitioned the data by the date_built field and saved it as Parquet files, a format that allows for faster data access.
I created a temporary table for this partitioned data and re-ran my queries to compare the performance with uncached queries.
Uncaching and Verification:
I also explored the process of uncaching the temporary data table to verify that Spark had properly removed it from memory.

Key Results:
Average Prices: I calculated the average price for homes based on specific characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. These insights can be used by real estate analysts to understand pricing trends over time.

Optimization: By caching and partitioning the data, I was able to significantly reduce the time it took to run the same queries, demonstrating how these techniques can improve performance when working with large datasets.

Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates how to efficiently process and analyze large datasets using Apache Spark. By leveraging techniques like SQL queries, caching, and partitioning, I was able to extract valuable insights from the home sales data, while optimizing the performance of the queries. Whether you're a data professional looking to understand pricing trends or a business leader interested in improving data access speed, this approach offers a clear pathway to achieving these goals.
